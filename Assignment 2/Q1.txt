For the given Structural problem, I am currently inclined towards gradient free optimization methods 
as I can not find the way to represent the discreet density function as a continuous function.

Mostly we go for gradient based optimzation as far as possible. In this case, the density is a discreet function.
The Density is either 1 or 0 and hence, it is not possible to calculate the gradient.
This makes it problematic to use gradient-based optimization method.
If we somehow rewrite the problem formulation such that the Discreet nature of Density is converted to continous,
we would surely go for a gradient-based optimization. Here, since I am not able to formulate the problem in such way,
I will be proceeding with Gradient-free optimization
